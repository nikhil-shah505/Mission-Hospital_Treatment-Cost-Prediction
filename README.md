# Mission-Hospital_Treatment-Cost-Prediction
Mission Hospital is a Super Spatiality Hospital in Durgapur, West Bengal specialized in Cardiovascular surgeries and they are trying to decentralize the entire management system by initiating “Packaged Pricing” for the patients coming from different parts of the country and neighbouring countries. The hospital is considering optimizing its model to increase customers' confidence as well as make its pricing policy more accurate so that hospital won’t incur losses.   The flat prices for various treatments are becoming common in Indian hospitals, mostly owing to health tourism and government institutions. Dr. Satyajit Bose, President of Mission Hospital, is considering implementing a flat-rate approach to give a patient a fixed price for their therapy on admission. This will mean that based on the patient's clinical and non-clinical details available at the time of admission, the package price should be determined by the hospital. Flat fees (or packaged pricing) may cause hospital loss if the care expenses of patients are not correctly measured. It is crucial for the Hospital to determine the major factors driving the actual cost of care to quote the patient for an approximate rate of treatment.
To Identify the problems in the dataset and measures to clean it:
There are dummy variables created in the data but some of them are missing, hence need to create remaining dummy variables.

Missing / NA values: As it is medical data, it is a good practice to remove the NA/missing data instead of doing imputation of values. Mean, Mode, KNN or any kind of imputation is very risky for a medical health data, so it is best not to impute but to remove the rows. But in the given dataset if we remove all missing and NA values we are left with only 25% of data. Hence, omitting the missing data also won’t be a feasible solution. 
(For now, we have kept NA values as it is as they are not a part of our regression model in the given situation.)

Develop a forward Multiple Linear Regression using the relevant variables given in question 4, and identify statistically significant predictors that mission hospital can use to find Treatment Cost? Also do the heteroscedasticity analysis and write the report?
